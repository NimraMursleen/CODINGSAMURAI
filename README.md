# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project  
This is my Coding Samurai internship project: a Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer using AI.

# How to Run  
- Open `TicTacToe.cpp` in a C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio 2022).  
- Compile and run the program.  
- Play the game against the AI.

# Features  
- Human vs Computer gameplay  
- AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** for optimal moves  
- Input validation for safe moves  
- Detects win, loss, or tie
